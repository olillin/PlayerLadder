# PlayerLadder
Adds the ability to ride/pick up other players on the head by right-clicking on them.

InÂ **1.19.4+** gives the ability to mount entities on players by using /ride.

You can also install it on the client:<br>
In **1.20.1**: it will offset the rider in the first person.<br>
In **1.21**: it will give you the ability to interact with the world when someone is sitting on top of you(you will need to enable **allowInteractions**).

To enable [Pick Up Me]([https://modrinth.com/mod/pickup-me](https://modrinth.com/mod/pickup-me)) functionality, you need to switch **rightClickMode** to "PICK_UP"

Only the latest version of Minecraft is supported.
